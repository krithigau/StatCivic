#  StatCivic: Intelligent Grievance Redressal System

> **Bridging the gap between Citizens and Administration through AI-driven governance.**

##  Overview
**StatCivic** is a modern, full-stack web application designed to streamline the chaotic process of civic grievance reporting. It replaces outdated, confusing government portals with a **smart, transparent, and responsive** platform.

The core innovation is the **Smart Routing Engine**, which analyzes user descriptions in real-time to automatically categorize complaints (e.g., "Streetlight broken" -> "Electricity Board") without human error.
